# Chemistry-Demonstration
Course project for Advance Javascript and CSS (Spring 2021, UW)

## Objective
As an instructor in Chemistry at a community college, I sometimes would like to conduct some demonstrations to showcase to my students.  However, with all the resources on Youtube, it is difficult to filter and keep track of which demo to do under what circumstances.  I would like to create a website that has different filtering functions, so it is easier for me to conduct search when preparing for my classes.

## Plan
I am planning to make a website that hosts a place where users can find different science demo that can be done on different institutions. Below are the different pages that I have in mind:

### Index Page
This page will contain a welcome message to the users, indicate the objective of the site, and provide some demonstrations of what the website contains.

### About / Contact Information
This page will contain a full-length introduction about how this page is built, and contact information for the users to contact the website admin!

### Complete List
This page is the place where people can go to find the demonstrations (in lists), with functions that can help filter the demonstrations (based on topic, etc).  Each will have a short introduction for each demonstration

### Individual page of each demonstration
This page contains more detailed information about the demonstration after the user select it from the “list” page.  Include the demonstration video, topics that it can be used it, the materials needed, and user comments.  There is also going to a place where users can share their experience with the website and post their comments on different demonstrations that is available (user experience, potential hiccups, etc)

## API in mind
The API that can potentially be incorporated the Youtube data base and use it as a backend resource for all the demonstrations.  Other sources can also be embedded depending on what resource was found later.
